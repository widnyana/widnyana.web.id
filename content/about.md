I'm **Wid**nyana, a System Architect building reliable, scalable systems that remain simple and maintainable at any scale. With 11+ years in cloud infrastructure, software engineering, and automation, I make technology quieter so teams can focus on what matters.

I'm open to mentoring, partnering on side projects, brainstorming, beta testing new products, and writing. I'm also open for pro-bono activity, contact me if you need one.
