I'm **Wid**nyana, a System Architect building reliable, scalable systems that remain simple and maintainable at any scale. With 11+ years in Cloud Infrastructure, software engineering, and automation, I make technology quieter so teams can focus on what matters.

I mentor engineers, collaborate on side projects, take on pro-bono work, and am open to brainstorming sessions or beta testing opportunities.
